# Captain America: Civil War - A Cinematic Marvel
=====================================================

## Overview
---------------

Released in 2016, "Captain America: Civil War" is the 13th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. The movie is loosely based on the "Civil War" comic book storyline, bringing to screen a clash between the Avengers, fueled by governmental oversight and accountability.

## Plot Summary

The film opens with the Avengers on a mission in Lagos, Nigeria, where an unintended consequence leads to civilian casualties. This event prompts the United Nations to propose the Sokovia Accords, which would regulate the team's actions. The Avengers are divided: Iron Man (Tony Stark) supports the Accords, feeling guilty for creating Ultron, while Captain America (Steve Rogers) opposes them, fearing they will limit the team's ability to protect the world.

Meanwhile, a bombing at the UN headquarters in Vienna, attributed to Bucky Barnes (Winter Soldier), draws Captain America into a conflict that escalates the rift within the Avengers. The team is eventually split, with Captain America's faction (including Falcon, Winter Soldier, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye, and Ant-Man) on the run from the law and Iron Man's faction (including Black Widow, War Machine, Spider-Man, Vision, and Black Panther) tasked with capturing them.
